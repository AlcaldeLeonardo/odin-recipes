            <li>salt, pepper and nutmeg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour the flour onto the board or counter, forming a small mound
                and make a volcano in its center by pressing with the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the hole formed, drop the three eggs. Do not add salt,
                because fresh pasta does not have it.
            </li>
            <li>
                With a fork, go beating from the inside out, incorporating a
                little more flour each time.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the fork is no longer enough, knead by hand until all the
                ingredients have been perfectly integrated. The dough is quite
                hard, but with 5 minutes of kneading you will get the right
                texture
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and store it in the fridge while
                you prepare the rest of the steps.
            </li>
            <li>
                To start with the filling, put a round of oil in a large frying
                pan and add the kilo of minced meat. Cook over medium/high heat
                until browned, stirring to break up any lumps of meat. This will
                take you about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the meat begins to brown, add the finely chopped onion and
                2 minced garlic cloves. Take advantage of this moment to add a
                touch of salt and pepper. Stir about 5 minutes until the onion
                begins to soften.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the glass of white wine into the pan and let the alcohol
                evaporate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomato. In this case, it is a can of crushed natural
                tomato, although you can use a ready-made tomato sauce and save
                yourself this step. Add salt and pepper and cook covered over
                low heat for about 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the béchamel, start by melting the diced butter in a
                saucepan, when it is melted, add the flour and stir so that both
                ingredients are integrated and the flour begins to brown. That
                is the time to add the milk and keep stirring to break up the
                lumps and get a uniform sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you've achieved the desired texture, add a pinch of salt,
                black pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the tomato sauce is being made, we are going to prepare
                the fresh pasta. Take it out of the fridge and the filo paper
                and, on the floured board, cut a portion of one third of the
                dough. Reserve the rest on plastic wrap. Crush it with your
                fingers and run it through the pasta maker. If you don't have
                one, you can squash it with a rolling pin, but it will cost a
                bit more. For the first pass, use the maximum thickness that the
                machine allows.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pick up the pasta, flour it and fold it in on itself to flatten
                it again, this time with the thickness number 7.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the process for the last pass, which you will do with
                thickness 4.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the pasta into equal pieces.</li>
            <li>
                Put water to boil in a pot with a handful of salt. Introduce
                each pasta sheet for a minute and then put it in cold water with
                ice to stop cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dry the lasagna sheets on a kitchen towel and see assembling the
                lasagna in a baking dish. Start by covering the bottom with
                bechamel, cover with two sheets of pasta and meat filling.
                Repeat this order until you have the desired layers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put a last layer of béchamel covering the lasagna and grate a
                generous amount of Parmesan cheese over it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the lasagna in the oven, previously preheated, at 220º for
                15 minutes with heat from above and below. Once baked, allow the
                layers to set for a few minutes and serve the portions with a
                spatula, but cut with a knife so the layers don't fall apart.
