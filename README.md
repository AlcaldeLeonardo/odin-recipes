# Odin-recipes

This project that is presented to me is a basic recipe web page

On this page I will try to handle the html syntax well, implement a version control and publish this project on the github page

### Conclusion

In this project I was able to implement, or at least try, the best practices in git, such as putting a title followed by a well descriptive paragraph. I have implemented for the first time the SSH protocol. Being forced to document myself about the keys and how to generate them using the console and then add them to my github account. A very interesting project that reinforced knowledge and helped me better understand the technologies I use.
